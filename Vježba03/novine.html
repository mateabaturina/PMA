                    meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my<br>

                    with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the<br>
                    presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of<br>
                    that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an<br>
                    eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads...</p>
