            <p class="prviOdlomak">
                Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind
                Christopher Robin.
                It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really
                is
                another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps
                there
                isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.<br>
                When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, "But I thought he was a boy?"<br>
                "So did I," said Christopher Robin.<br>
                "Then you can't call him Winnie?"<br>
                "I don't."<br>
                "But you said——"<br>
                "He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what 'ther' means?"<br>
                "Ah, yes, now I do," I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it is all the explanation you are
                going to
                get.<br>
                Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he likes to
                sit
                quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story. This evening——<br>
                "What about a story?" said Christopher Robin.<br>
                "What about a story?" I said.<br>
                "Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?"<br>
                "I suppose I could," I said. "What sort of stories does he like?"<br>
                "About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear."<br>
                "Oh, I see."<br>
                "So could you very sweetly?"<br>
                "I'll try," I said.<br>
                So I tried.<br>

                Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by
                himself
                under the name of Sanders.

            <h2>IN WHICH POOH GOES VISITING AND GETS INTO A TIGHT PLACE</h2>
            <img src="img/chapter2.jpg" alt="Edward Bear in front of the glass">
            <hr>
            <p class="prviOdlomak">
                Edward Bear, known to his friends as Winnie-the-Pooh, or Pooh for short, was walking through the forest
                one day,
                humming proudly to himself. He had made up a little hum that very morning, as he was doing his Stoutness
                Exercises in front of the glass: Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, as he stretched up as high as he could go, and
                then
                Tra-la-la, tra-la—oh, help!—la, as he tried to reach his toes. After breakfast he had said it over and
                over to
                himself until he had learnt it off by heart, and now he was humming it right through, properly. It went
                like
                this:<br>
                <i>Tra-la-la, tra-la-la,<br>
                    Tra-la-la, tra-la-la,<br>
                    Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.<br>
                    Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,<br>
                    Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,<br>
                    Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um.</i>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="drugiOdlomak">
                Well, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily, wondering what everybody else was
                doing, and
                what it felt like, being somebody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank, and in the bank was a
                large
                hole.<br>
                "Aha!" said Pooh.<i>(Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.)</i>"If I know anything about anything, that hole means
                Rabbit," he
                said, "and Rabbit means Company," he said, "and Company means Food and Listening-to-Me-Humming and such
                like.<i>Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um</i>."<br>
                So he bent down, put his head into the hole, and called out:<br>
                "Is anybody at home?"<br>
                There was a sudden scuffling noise from inside the hole, and then silence.<br>
                "What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?'" called out Pooh very loudly.<br>
                "No!" said a voice; and then added, "You needn't shout so loud. I heard you quite well the first
                time."<br>
                "Bother!" said Pooh. "Isn't there anybody here at all?"<br>
                "Nobody."<br>
                Winnie-the-Pooh took his head out of the hole, and thought for a little, and he thought to himself,
                "There must
                be somebody there, because somebody must have said 'Nobody.'" So he put his head back in the hole, and
                said:<br>
                "Hallo, Rabbit, isn't that you?"<br>
                "No," said Rabbit, in a different sort of voice this time.<br>
                "But isn't that Rabbit's voice?"<br>
                "I don't <i>think</i> so," said Rabbit. "It isn't meant to be."<br>
                "Oh!" said Pooh.<br>
                He took his head out of the hole, and had another think, and then he put it back, and said:<br>
                "Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is?"<br>
                "He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear, who is a great friend of his."<br>
                "But this <i>is</i> Me!" said Bear, very much surprised.<br>
                "What sort of Me?"<br>
                "Pooh Bear."<br>
                "Are you sure?" said Rabbit, still more surprised.<br>
                "Quite, quite sure," said Pooh.<br>
                "Oh, well, then, come in."<br>

            <h2>IN WHICH POOH AND PIGLET GO HUNTING AND NEARLY CATCH A WOOZLE</h2>
            <img src="img/chapter3.jpg" alt="Piglet house">
            <hr>
            <p class="prviOdlomak">
                The Piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of a beech-tree, and the beech-tree was in the
                middle of
                the forest, and the Piglet lived in the middle of the house. Next to his house was a piece of broken
                board which
                had: "TRESPASSERS W" on it. When Christopher Robin asked the Piglet what it meant, he said it was his
                grandfather's name, and had been in the family for a long time, Christopher Robin said you couldn't be
                called
                Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could, because his grandfather was, and it was short for
                Trespassers
                Will, which was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two names in case he lost
                one—Trespassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers.<br>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="drugiOdlomak">
                "I've got two names," said Christopher Robin carelessly.<br>
                "Well, there you are, that proves it," said Piglet.<br>
                One fine winter's day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house, he happened to look
                up, and
                there was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pooh was walking round and round in a circle, thinking of something else, and
                when
                Piglet called to him, he just went on walking.<br>
                "Hallo!" said Piglet, "what are you doing?"<br>
                "Hunting," said Pooh.<br>
                "Hunting what?"<br>
                "Tracking something," said Winnie-the-Pooh very mysteriously.<br>
                "Tracking what?" said Piglet, coming closer.<br>
                "That's just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?"<br>
                "What do you think you'll answer?"<br>
                "I shall have to wait until I catch up with it," said Winnie-the-Pooh. "Now, look there." He pointed to
                the
                ground in front of him. "What do you see there?"<br>
