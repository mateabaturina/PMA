        All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One
        day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to
        her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and
        cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but
        henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the
        end.<br>
        Of course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady, with a
        romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other,
        that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking
        mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the
        right-hand corner.<br>

        Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her
        evening out. She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling
        screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look
        for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but
        what she thought was a shooting star.<br>
        She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy’s shadow. As
        he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get
        out; slam went the window and snapped it off.<br>

        For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children
        continued to burn clearly. They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they
        could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned
        also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.<br>
        There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we
        have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow, rummaged the
        wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light; it made this light by flashing about so
        quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still
        growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through
        which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to <i>embonpoint</i>.<br>
